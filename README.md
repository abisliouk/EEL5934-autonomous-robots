# EEL 5934 - Autonomous Robots

This repository contains assignments for the [EEL 5934 Autonomous Robots](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/) course at the University of Florida. The assignments focus on key robotics topics such as camera interfacing, image processing, and control.

## ðŸ“Œ Assignments Overview

### **1st Assignment: Camera Interfacing in ROS**
- Implemented ROS 2 package `image_processor` to interface a USB camera.
- Converted ROS 2 image messages to OpenCV images using `cv_bridge`.
- Processed images using OpenCV to detect faces and draw bounding boxes.
- Published processed images as a new ROS 2 topic `/out/image`.
- Used `rqt_image_view` to visualize the processed image.
- Created a launch file to start all necessary ROS 2 nodes.
